Style Guide 

Here's a list of style guide recommendations I use for maintaining a consistent and organized codebase in a React project:

1. Code Formatting: I use a consistent code formatting tool i.e Prettier to ensure uniform code style.

2. Indentation: I use a consistent number of spaces or tabs for indentation. I choose 2 indentation and stick with it throughout the project.

3. Naming Conventions: I followed aconsistent naming conventions for variables, functions, components, and files. Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for components and lowercase for classnames in css.

4. Folder Structure: I organized my project files into logical folders (e.g., components, modules, assets ) to maintain a clear project structure.

5. Component Structure:I followed a consistent component structure that includes separate folders for component code, and styles when needed.

6. CSS-in-JS or Stylesheets: I choose a styling approach of Styled Components and stick with it for consistent styling across components.

7. TypeScript: I use TypeScript to define and enforce prop types and component interfaces.

8. Imports and Exports: I used explicit imports and exports to improve code readability and prevent unused imports.

9. Avoid Deep Nesting: I limited component nesting to avoid deep hierarchies. 

10. Single Responsibility Principle: I Kept components focused on a single responsibility, promoting reusability and maintainability.

11. Commenting: I added comments to clarify complex logic, edge cases, and code intentions.

12. Avoid Inline Styles: I avoided using inline styles, as they can make code harder to maintain and style consistently.
